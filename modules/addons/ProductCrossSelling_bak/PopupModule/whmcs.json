Together with it, you will be able to determine when exactly the message shall be available. Pop-up advertisements can be displayed e.g. on particular days of the week, or only if a visitor stays long enough on your website. The module will also allow you to limit the access to notifications to specific pages of client area only. Every pop-up you create can take the form of a text, HTML or an image. Additionally, you may choose from 26 predefined styles or generate your own ones to further personalize its design. If permitted, your customers will be free to turn off each pop-up once familiar with the message or the content is simply not relevant.",
